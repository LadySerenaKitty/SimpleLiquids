# about

This module adds a simple propagation algorithm for liquids (e.g., water) to the game. 

Each water block is treated as an infinite water source. The propagation is triggered whenever a new water block is placed or a block 
neighboring a liquid is destroyed. The water will propagate downwards until it hits solid ground, then it will spread out to the sides.
